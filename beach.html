            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Located in the Udupi district of Karnataka, India, Kaup Beach is one of the lesser-known gems of the Arabian Sea coastline. Known for its serene atmosphere and picturesque landscapes, this charming beach has been attracting visitors seeking tranquility away from the bustling city life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The history of tourism at Kaup Beach has not been extensively documented. However, it is known that over the past few decades, the region has gradually emerged as a tourist destination. Initially frequented by locals and nearby residents, the beach began to gain popularity among the wider Indian populace and eventually international visitors.
            </p>
            <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
            <p>
                Kaup Beach also has a historic lighthouse which has stood the test of time. Built in 1901, the lighthouse offers a panoramic view of the beach and has been a constant attractant for visitors interested in both history and scenic beauty.

        <section id="lighthouse">
            <h2>Lighthouse</h2>
            <img src="lighthouse.jpg" alt="Lighthouse">
            <p>
                Kapu beach also referred to as Kaup beach is located about 2 km from the highway connecting Mangalore and Udupi in Karnataka. The best time to visit the beach is during sunset. The lighthouse is open to visitors from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the beaches of Gokarna are gaining the attention of foreign travelers for their proximity to Goa, a lot of pristine beaches down south in Karnataka go unnoticed. Kapu is undoubtedly one among the best-kept secrets of Karnataka. What is more compelling about Kapu is the 27 mt high lighthouse which is still functional. Built in 1901 on a huge boulder on the Arabian coast, the lighthouse at Kapu beach has for many years stood unperturbed guiding thousands of sailors and warning the presence of dangerous rocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we visited, the beach was mostly secluded except for a few people who were playing with the waves. The huge waves which crashed against the boulders splashing high in the air made for an enthralling sight. There was a small rivulet that joined the Arabian Sea just beside the lighthouse. A huge cast of tiny crabs wandering on the banks of the shallow rivulet that meandered out from the coconut groves was fun to watch. A couple of colorful fishing boats were parked on the beach after they were back from the day's catch. As the sun slowly descended towards the horizon, more people started gathering at the beach, most of them were students from the nearby colleges.
